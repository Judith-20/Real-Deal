                  There are individuals who choose to repaint their homes upon
                  purchase to modify the color scheme, while others opt for a
                  fresh coat of paint before listing their property for sale to
                  improve its exterior attractiveness. However, it's typical to
                  repaint one's home every 5-10 years or every 4-7 years if it
                  has a stained finish. Houses located near the sea usually
                  require more frequent painting due to the corrosive sea
                  breeze. Several elements, such as the level of preparation
                  carried out previously (including sanding and scraping) and
                  the grade of the paint selected, play a role in determining
                  how long the paint lasts. In the case of stained surfaces,
                  it's noticeable when the wood starts drying. Paint may also
                  become chalky or lose its vibrance due to prolonged exposure
                  to sunlight. Inferior paint with sparse pigment can manifest
                  uneven tones based on how sunlight hits it. It is advisable to
                  repaint stucco every 5-7 years; failure to do so can lead to
                  cracks or chunks falling off. A good number of homeowners
                  adopt a regimen of repainting every 5-7 years, likening it to
                  changing a vehicle's oil, to avert potential damage.

                  In preparation for interior painting, we advise to relocate
                  small and fragile items. If you feel confident in handling
                  them yourself, you may consider taking down pictures or
                  mirrors from the walls. For heavier objects that cannot be
                  easily moved, our team will take care of moving them. We will
                  also ensure thorough coverage of everything using plastic
                  sheets and tarps. As for exterior painting, it is recommended
                  to move small items such as potted plants away from the house.
                  If you have window-based air conditioning units, it is
                  preferable to bring them indoors. If assistance is needed, we
                  are more than happy to help. We also recommend that you park
                  your car away from your house and that you provide access to
                  hose water for our use.

                  Typically, exterior paint reaches a dry-to-touch state within
                  approximately two hours of application. However, it is
                  essential to allow a minimum of four hours of drying time
                  before applying a recoat. On the other hand, interior paint
                  generally dries to the touch within an hour or two after
                  application.

                  The longevity of paint and stain on surfaces is influenced by
                  various factors such as climate, sun exposure, and the quality
                  of preparation. When the surface has undergone proper
                  preparation, including thorough sanding and caulking, and is
                  free from rot and gutter issues, the application of
                  high-quality paint can typically provide a lasting finish of
                  around 8 to 10 years. Stain, on the other hand, presents a
                  slightly more complex situation as its durability depends on
                  factors like sun exposure, climate, and the darkness of the
                  stain. Generally, stain can endure anywhere between 4 to 12
                  years.
